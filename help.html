          Welcome and thank you for using Sif. The completely offline, open source and platform/OS agnostic CRM (customer relation management) tool. <br/><br/>
          Sif is a little different than your average "App".<br/>
          The workflow goes like this:
          <ol>
            <li>You select a .db (database) file to load into Sif (if it's your first time using is, there's a "sif.db" file in the "db" folder for you to start off with.)</li>
            <li>Any and all changes are held in memory</li>
            <li>On logout (or save), Sif will write out all changes to a file and ask you where you want to save it.
          </ol>
